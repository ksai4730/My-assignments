                <p id="second"> The Coca-Cola Company is a publicly listed company, meaning there is not one sole owner, but rather the company is 'owned' by thousands of 
                shareholders and investors around the world. However, the largest shareowner of the company is American businessman Warren Buffett</p>
                <h4 id="third">Background. The Coca-Cola Company started operating in India in 1950. However, in 1977, they withdrew operations from the country in protest of regulations
                     and legislation by the Government of India limiting the dilution of equity of multinational corporations.</h4>
