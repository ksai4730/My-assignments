                Two women broke the record for the fastest trip around the world on a tandem bike.
            </h1>
            <p>Cat Dixon and Raz Marsden left England in June 2019 on their tandem bike with one goal in mind: to bike across the 
                world faster than anyone had before. After 263 days, 8 hours and 7 minutes, 25 countries, and 18,263 miles, the pair
                 broke the world record, according to Guinness World Records. 

                "We have highlights from every country that we visited and would definitely return to see many— although maybe at a
                 slower pace," Dixon and Marsden said in a joint statement. 
                
                The two even had to battle monsoons, heatwaves, and the potential of borders closing amid the outbreak of the coronavirus 
                pandemic. 
                
                "We just got on with it and loved it all. It was important to keep laughing, and we did," they said.

                One woman earned the title of "most cinema productions attended" after seeing "Bohemian Rhapsody" over 100 times.

            </h1>
            <p>Joanne Connor, who lives in Redcliffe, Brisbane, discovered a new-found passion when she first watched "Bohemian Rhapsody" 
                in theaters. She became so enamored with the Queen biopic that she saw the film 107 more times. This year, she earned the 
                Guinness World Record title of "most cinema productions attended – same film." 

                "I love this movie. It is the best I have ever seen," Connor told Guinness World Records. "It is such a 'feel-good' movie 
                and takes those of us that weren't there right to Wembley Live Aid. Also doing it to continue the legacy of the legend,
                 Freddie Mercury and the music of Queen."

                A 10-year-old boy is being called a math genius after solving 196 math questions in one minute.

            </h1>
            <p>Nadub Gill is a 10-year-old who has always been great at math, but this year, he proved just how much of a genius he really 
                is. Gill was one of 700 children to try the Times Tables Rock Stars, which challenges students to answer as many 
                multiplication and division questions as they can in one minute. He answered 196 correct, which is three answers every 
                second. 

                "I am very thrilled and excited to achieve this title. It is like a dream," Gill told Guinness World Records. "I am thankful 
                my school and my teachers, who encouraged me to attempt this record. They encouraged me a lot and I think they have played a big
                 role in my success."
